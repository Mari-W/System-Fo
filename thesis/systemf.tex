\subsection{Specification}
\subsubsection{Sorts}\hfill\\\\
The formalization of System F requires three sorts: \Constr{eₛ} for expressions, \Constr{τₛ} for types and \Constr{κₛ} for kinds. 
\FSort
Sorts are indexed by boolean data type \Data{Ctxable} indicating if terms of the sort can appear in contexts.
Going forward, we use \Sym{s} as variable name for sorts and \Sym{S} for lists of sorts.

\subsubsection{Syntax}\hfill\\\\
The syntax of System F is represented as a single data type \Data{Term} indexed by a list of sorts \Sym{S} and sort \Sym{s}. 
The length of \Sym{S} represents the amount of bound variables and the elements \Sym{s$_i$} of the list represent the sort of the variable bound at that position. The index \Sym{S} is inspired by Debruijn indices where we reference variables using numbers that count the amount many binders we need to go back to where the variable was bound. The list \Sym{S} extends this idea by allowing to reference variables of different sorts.
The second index \Sym{s} represents the sort of the term itself.
\FTerm
Variables \Constr{`}\ \Sym{x} are represented as references \Sym{s} \Prim{∈} \Sym{S} to an element in \Sym{S}.
Memberships of type \Sym{s} \Prim{∈} \Sym{S} are defined similar to natural numbers and can either be \Constr{here refl} where \Constr{refl} is prove we found our element or \Constr{there} \Sym{x} where \Sym{x} is another membership. 
In consequence we can only reference already bound variables using memberships in \Sym{S}.
The unit element \Constr{tt} and unit type \Constr{`⊤} represent base types. Lambda abstractions \Constr{λ`x→} \Sym{e'} result in function types \Sym{τ₁} \Constr{⇒} \Sym{τ₂} and type abstractions \Constr{Λ`α→} \Sym{e'} result in forall types \Constr{∀`α} \Sym{τ'}. 
To eliminate abstractions we use application \Sym{e₁} \Constr{·} \Sym{e₂} for lambda abstractions and type application \Sym{e} \Constr{•} \Sym{τ} for type abstractions. 
Let bindings \Constr{let`x=} \Sym{e₂} \Constr{`in} \Sym{e₁} combine abstraction and application. All types \Sym{τ} have kind \Constr{⋆}.
We will use shorthands \FVar, \FExpr\ and \FType\ and variable names \Sym{x}, \Sym{e} and \Sym{τ} respectively as well as \Sym{t} for arbitrary \Data{Term} \Sym{S} \Sym{s}.

\subsubsection{Renaming}\hfill\\\\
Renamings \Sym{ρ} of type \Data{Ren} \Sym{S₁} \Sym{S₂} are defined as total functions mapping variables \Data{Var} \Sym{S₁} \Sym{s} to variables \Data{Var} \Sym{S₂} \Sym{s} preserving the sort \Sym{s} of the variable.
\FRen
Applying a renaming \Data{Ren} \Sym{S₁} \Sym{S₂} to a term \Data{Term} \Sym{S₁} \Sym{s} yields a new term \Data{Term} \Sym{S₂} \Sym{s} where variables are now represented as references \Sym{s} \Prim{∈} \Sym{S₂} to elements in \Sym{S₂}.
\Fren
When we encounter a binder, the renaming is extended using \Frenext. 
The weakening of a term can be defined as shifting all variables by one.
\Fwk 
Since variables are represented as references to a list, shifting variables is simply wrapping them in the \Constr{there} constructor.

\subsubsection{Substitution}\hfill\\\\
Substitutions \Sym{σ} of type \Data{Sub} \Sym{S₁} \Sym{S₂} are similar to renamings but rather than mapping variables to variables, substitutions map variables to terms.
\FSub
Applying a substitution to a term \Fsub\ is analogous to the applying a renaming. 
Single substitution \Sym{t} \Data{[} \Sym{t'} \Data{]} substitutes the last bound variable in \Sym{t} with \Sym{t'}.
\Fsubs
A single substitution \Fsinglesub\ takes a substitution \Sym{σ} and term \Sym{t'} to introduce \Sym{t'} to \Sym{σ}. In the case of \Data{\_[\_]} we let \Sym{σ} be the identity substitution \Fidsub.

\subsubsection{Context}\hfill\\\\
The typing context \Data{Ctx} \Sym{S} is indexed by sorts \Sym{S} similar to terms. 
\FCtx
A context can either be empty \Constr{∅} or cons \Sym{Γ} \Constr{▶} \Sym{T} where \Sym{T} is a term of the kind of sort \Sym{s}. The function \Data{kind-of} maps sorts that can appear in contexts to the sorts of their kind.
\Fkind
Expressions have kind \Constr{τₛ}, while types have kind \Constr{κₛ}. We will use \Sym{T} as shorthand for the term with sort \Data{kind-of} \Sym{s}.

\subsubsection{Typing}\hfill\\\\
The typing relation \Sym{Γ} \Data{⊢} \Sym{t} \Data{:} \Sym{T} relates terms \Sym{t} to their typing kind \Sym{T} in context \Sym{Γ}.
\FTyping
Rule \Constr{⊢`x} says that variables \Constr{`} \Sym{x} have type \Sym{τ} if \Sym{x} has type \Sym{τ} in \Sym{Γ}. Next, \Constr{⊢⊤} states that unit expressions \Constr{tt} has type \Constr{`⊤}. 
%TODO
Finally, rule \Constr{⊢τ} indicates that all types \Sym{τ} are well formed and have kind \Constr{⋆}. Type variables are correctly typed per definition and type constructors \Constr{∀`α} and \Constr{⇒} accept arbitrary types as their arguments.

\subsubsection{Typing Renaming \& Substitution}\hfill\\\\
Because of extrinsic typing we need to type both renamings and substitutions. We formalized typed renamings in the form of order preserving embeddings. In contrast du typed substituted we do not allow arbitrary typed renamings.
TODO Hannes
\FRenTyping
The identity renaming \Constr{⊢idᵣ} typed per definition. The extension of a renaming \Constr{⊢extᵣ} allows to extend both \Sym{Γ₁} and \Sym{Γ₂} by \Sym{T'} and renamed \Sym{T'} respectively. Constructor \Constr{⊢extᵣ} corresponds to the typed version of function \Data{extᵣ}. Further, constructor \Constr{⊢dropᵣ} allows us to introduce \Sym{T'} only in \Sym{Γ₂} and drop \Sym{T'} in \Sym{Γ₁}. TODO
Typed Substitutions are defined as total function, equivalently to untyped substitutions.
\FSubTyping
Typed substitutions map variables \Sym{x} to the corresponding typed terms of the substituted variable \Sym{Γ} \Data{⊢} \Sym{σ} \Sym{x} \Data{:} $($\Data{sub} \Sym{σ} $($\Data{lookup} \Sym{Γ₁} \Sym{x}$))$. 
\subsubsection{Semantics}\hfill\\\\
The semantics are formalized call-by-value, that is, there is no reduction under binders. Values are indexed by there irreducible expression.
\FVal
System F has three values. The two closure values \Constr{v-λ} and \Constr{v-Λ} for abstractions waiting for their argument and unit value \Constr{v-tt}.
We formalize semantics as small step semantics, where each constructor represents a single reduction step \Sym{e} \Constr{↪} \Sym{e'}.
We distinguish between \Sym{β} and \Sym{ξ} rules. Meaningful computation in the form of substitution is done by \Sym{β} rules while \Sym{ξ} rules reduce sub expressions.
\FSemantics
Rules \Constr{β-λ} and \Constr{β-Λ} give meaning to application and type application in the form of substituting the applied term into the abstraction. Further, \Constr{β-let} is equivalent to application rule \Constr{β-λ}. Rules \Constr{ξ-·$_i$} and \Constr{ξ-•} evaluate sub expressions of application until \Sym{e₁} and \Sym{e₂}, or \Sym{e} respectively, are values. Finally, \Constr{ξ-let} reduces the bound expression \Sym{e₂} until \Sym{e₂} is a value and \Constr{β-let} can be applied.    
\subsection{Soundness}

\subsubsection{Progress}\hfill\\\\
We prove progress, that is, a typed expression \Sym{Γ} \Data{⊢} \Sym{e} \Data{:} \Sym{τ} can either be further reduced to some \Sym{e'} or \Sym{e} is a value, by induction over the typing rules. 
\FProgress
Cases \Constr{⊢⊤}, \Constr{⊢λ} and \Constr{⊢Λ} result in values. Application cases \Constr{⊢·}, \Constr{⊢•} and \Constr{⊢let} follow directly from the induction hypothesis. 
\subsubsection{Subject Reduction}\hfill\\\\
Finally, we prove subject reduction, that is, reductions preserve typing. A expression \Sym{e} with type \Sym{τ} still has type \Sym{τ} after being reduced to \Sym{e'}. We prove subject reduction by induction over the reduction rules. 
\FSubjectReduction
Cases \Constr{ξ-·₁}, \Constr{ξ-·₂}, \Constr{ξ-•} and \Constr{ξ-let} follow directly from the induction hypothesis. For beta reduction cases \Constr{β-λ}, \Constr{β–Λ} and \Constr{β-let} we need to prove that substitution preserves typing both for substitutions \Sym{e} \Data{[}  \Sym{e} \Data{]} and \Sym{e} \Data{[}  \Sym{τ} \Data{]}. Both lemmas follow from a more general lemma \Data{⊢σ-preserves}.
\Fpreserves
We can prove \Data{⊢σ-preserves} by induction over typing rules.
