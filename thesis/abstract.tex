Most popular strongly typed programming languages support function overloading. 
In combination with polymorphism this leads to essential language constructs, for example typeclasses in Haskell or traits in Rust.  
We introduce System \Fo, a minimal language extension to System F, with support for overloading.
Furthermore, we prove the Dictionary Passing Transform from System \Fo\ to System F to be type-preserving using Agda.
